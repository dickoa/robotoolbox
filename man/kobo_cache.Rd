\title{Session-level cache for KoboToolbox metadata}
\description{
Session-level caching for form metadata and languages. Form versions are
immutable and languages don't change, so caching is safe and significantly
improves performance.
}
\details{
Cached items:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Form metadata}: When \code{all_versions = TRUE} in \code{kobo_data()}, multiple
API calls are made to fetch form schemas for each version. Caching
eliminates redundant calls within a session.
\item \strong{Languages}: \code{kobo_lang()} results are cached per asset, speeding up
\code{kobo_lang_set()} and \code{kobo_lang_get()} operations.
}

Cache is stored in memory and cleared when R session ends.

Note: Version lists are NOT cached as they can change when users deploy
new form versions, and the API call sequence is required by the server.
